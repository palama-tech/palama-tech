Palama Technologies is a machine learning company that builds cost-effective, composable and secure machine learning models for use by enterprise clients. 

The GIF shows inference on a graph of retail product-locations (one product in one store). 
- Learning is performed dynamically to track customer behaviours as they evolve through time.
- Inferences are shared across the graph so that every product-location learns from other relevant product-locations.
